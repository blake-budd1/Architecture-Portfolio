# Architecture-Portfolio
Worked with a UF Architecture student to create an online portfolio. Finished website link: jacksonbudd.com

Created an interactive design portfolio for a UF Architecture student, where the projects are able to be scrolled through to better understand the models and spaces.
Used CSS and JavaScript to create the design of the scrollable pages.
